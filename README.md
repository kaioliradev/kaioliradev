## Hello World! 👋

### `👤` **About me:**
> Hello, my name is Kaio Lira, I was born on November 26, 2008, and I'm from Vila Velha, Espírito Santo, Brazil. My programming journey began when I started playing FiveM (GTA RP) and discovered the world of technology there. From the age of 14 onwards, I started studying, increasing my focus at age 16. Since then, I've been a dedicated student and technology enthusiast. I started in front-end development but am looking to learn more to become a full-stack developer. I also have a slight interest in UI/UX Design and am looking to improve that skill as well.

### `🧠` **Technologies and knowledge:**

`💻` Programming Languages
